    <string name="intro_text">This application will coach you through a simple breathing routine.
        During this time, it will collect information about your heart rate from a heart rate monitor.
        This data will be stored on our secure server along with your name for research purposes.\n
        By using this app, you are helping us research the effect of heart rate variability (HRV) on
        overall health and wellness. Thank you for participating!\n
        When you are ready to begin, enter your first name in the field below and click "Start" to begin using the app.

    <string name="instructions">To use this app, just follow these steps:\n
        1. Put on your heart rate monitor and wait until the word "Connected" appears at the top of the screen.\n
        2. Press "Start" to begin your breathing session. Breathe in and out as instructed by the app.
        Please do not close the application or engage in other activities during the breathing session.
        3. After 5 minutes, you can stop the breathing session at any time by pressing the "Stop" button. You can stop the session before 5 minutes if you need to, but this will provide less useful data for our research.\n
        4. Wait until the app says that your data has been saved before closing the app.\n
